# Example: Apocalypse Hoarding + Space System (Classic Trope)
SCENARIO = """
I was reborn, back to three days before the apocalypse. In my previous life, because of my kindness, I shared my only food with my neighbors, only to be cruelly murdered by them.
This life, I've awakened the Infinite Space System. I'm going to hoard billions in supplies and build the strongest sanctuary.
First, I go to the largest supermarket and sweep all the instant noodles and sausages. Then I rent a huge warehouse and order 100 tons of rice.
When the apocalypse comes and zombies surround the city, my neighbors are starving and knocking on my door, while I'm inside eating hotpot and singing songs.

# Example 2: Normal Workplace Revenge (Needs T1/T3 Fission)
SCENARIO_WORKPLACE = """
I'm just an ordinary intern at the company, suppressed by my boss and having my achievements stolen by colleagues every day.
Until one day, I picked up the personal diary of the future Chairman.
I know who will be promoted, who will be fired, and which stocks will skyrocket.
This time, I will make everyone who looked down on me pay the price.
