## 🎯 Why do you need Siray Skills | Idea Validator?

In the AI Comic-Drama track, what determines views isn't "writing style," but **"Commercial Addictive Indicators."**

**Siray Skills Exclusive Advantages**:
- **One Key, All Models**: Built-in **Siray API** routing. With one single key, you can simultaneously orchestrate **Claude 4.5 Thinking (Best Overseas Creativity)** and **DeepSeek V3.2 (Best Domestic Logic)** for true cross-border, multi-platform model synergy.
- **Hybrid Cloud Evaluation**: Leverages the differentiated strengths of various models in linguistic understanding and logical deduction to provide a more objective and sharper commercial audit than any single model.

Pain points of traditional scriptwriting:
- **Subjective Evaluation**: Writing by "feel" without knowing if it hits the platform's algorithm-recommended trends.
- **Visual Stagnation**: Beautiful words that lack conflict when converted to AI images, resulting in low completion rates.
- **Innovation Hurdles**: Knowing a theme is cliché but not knowing how to perform "Setting Displacement" or "Reverse Upgrades" at key junctions.

**Siray Idea Validator** is designed to solve these. It integrates the official Siray Skills track strategy guide, serving as your "Chief Architect Assistant" before any script rollout.
