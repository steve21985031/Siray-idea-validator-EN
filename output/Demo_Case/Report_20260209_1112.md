## 📊 Step 2: Commercial Radar Scoring (DeepSeek)

* **Total Score**: 40 / 100 (C)
* **Market Fit**: 35
* **Visual Spectacle**: 70
* **Novelty**: 15

### Producer's Verdict
> A derivative, low-effort pile of overused tropes. 'Reborn apocalypse' is a saturated market; this script adds nothing. The 'Infinite Space System' is a lazy crutch, not a plot. Visuals are generic warehouse and supermarket sweeps—AI can generate it, but why would it want to? The protagonist is a bland power fantasy. The 'hotpot while neighbors starve' climax is emotionally shallow and predictable. This isn't a story; it's a checklist of web novel clichés assembled without craft or insight.

## ✨ Step 3: Creative Fission (Claude)

# 🎬 Script Reconstruction Report

## Original Diagnosis
The core failure: **Passive revenge fantasy + visual poverty**. The protagonist simply "has stuff" while others don't—no dramatic engine, no visual escalation, no moral complexity worth debating.

# Option A: T2/T5 Epic Narrative
## 「The Last Auction」

### 【Tactic Analysis】
| Tactic | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **T2 Scale Multiplier** | Transform "personal hoarding" → "economic warfare across survivor factions" |
| **T5 Visual-First** | Every supply transaction = life-or-death auction spectacle with countdown timers, bidding wars, desperate crowds |

### 【One-Sentence High Concept】
> *Reborn with infinite storage, he doesn't hoard supplies—he becomes the apocalypse's only bank, and the exchange rate is human dignity.*

### 【Golden 3-Second Hook】
**VISUAL:** Aerial shot of a crumbling stadium. Thousands of survivors packed in seats. Giant LED screen flickers: "LOT #127: 10KG RICE. STARTING BID: 3 LABOR YEARS."
**VO:** "They killed me for a can of meat. Now? They bid their freedom for my scraps."

### 【Reconstructed Beat Sheet】
1. **Cold Open:** Protagonist watches his own funeral from across the street—neighbors dividing his supplies, laughing
2. **System Twist:** Infinite Space doesn't just store—it *appraises*. Every item shows "Desperation Index" of who wants it most
3. **Visual Setpiece:** First auction in abandoned IKEA—survivors trade skills, secrets, even *memories* (system can extract and store them)
4. **Escalation:** Rival faction creates counterfeit "supply certificates." Economic warfare begins
5. **Climax:** The neighbor who killed him bids everything—including his daughter's future labor—for medicine. Protagonist's choice becomes the moral knife-edge

# Option B: T1/T3 Twist Narrative
## 「The Generous Hoarder」

### 【Tactic Analysis】
| Tactic | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **T1 Setting Displacement** | Apocalypse happens in a **luxury cruise ship** stuck at sea—enclosed ecosystem, limited escape routes |
| **T3 Micro-Innovation** | Invert the revenge fantasy: he hoards *to give away strategically*, engineering social debt as his weapon |

### 【One-Sentence High Concept】
> *Reborn on a cruise ship three days before infection, he hoards not to survive—but to make everyone owe him their lives, then collects.*

### 【Golden 3-Second Hook】
**VISUAL:** Pristine buffet. Protagonist calmly pockets shrimp while passengers laugh at him. Subtitle: "Day 1."
**SMASH CUT:** Same buffet, bodies everywhere, one passenger kneeling before him, offering a Rolex for a cracker.
**VO:** "They called me crazy. Now they call me *sir*."

### 【Reconstructed Beat Sheet】
1. **Setting Anchor:** Luxury cruise = visual contrast engine (chandeliers + blood, ballgowns + barricades)
2. **System Reframe:** Infinite Space has a *social ledger*—tracks who owes him, who betrayed him, who can be "redeemed"
3. **Micro-Twist:** He *gives* food freely at first—but system records everything. When scarcity hits, he "calls in favors" with surgical precision
4. **Character Innovation:** The neighbor who killed him is on the same cruise. Protagonist doesn't avoid him—he makes him his most loyal debtor
5. **Climax Inversion:** Final choice isn't "let them starve"—it's "forgive the debt and lose the system... or become the monster he died hating"

## Comparative Summary

| Element | Option A (Epic) | Option B (Twist) |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Scale** | City-wide faction warfare | Enclosed pressure cooker |
| **Visual Engine** | Auction spectacles, crowd dynamics | Luxury decay, intimate betrayals |
| **Moral Complexity** | Systemic critique (capitalism in apocalypse) | Personal corruption arc |
| **Viral Hook** | "Apocalypse economy" discourse | "Forgiveness vs. revenge" debate |
| **Production Cost** | Higher (crowds, locations) | Lower (single location, character-driven) |

---

### 🎯 Recommendation
**For algorithm virality:** Option B—enclosed settings trend better on short-form (see: *Squid Game*, *Platform*), and the "generous monster" archetype generates comment-section warfare.

**For premium adaptation potential:** Option A—scalable worldbuilding, franchise possibilities.
