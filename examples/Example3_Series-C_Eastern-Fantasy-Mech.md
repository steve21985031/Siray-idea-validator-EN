# Example 3: Series C - Eastern Fantasy Mech

### Original Script Snippet:
"In this world, spirit Qi isn't for meditation—it's for electricity. I am a low-level rune-smith's apprentice. While others try to cultivate their bodies, I'm building a 50-meter tall armor. Every joint is sealed with Golden Light Charms. The Immortal Sects call me a heretic, but my 'Rune-Mech' just punched their Grand Elder through a mountain."

### Track Objective:
Focus on "Visual Equality" and the "Violent Aesthetics" of technomancy.
