# Example 1: Series A - Apocalypse Hoarding

### Original Script Snippet:
"I was reborn, back to three days before the apocalypse. In my previous life, I was betrayed by my neighbors after sharing my food. This time, I awakened the Infinite Space System. I'm going to hoard billions in supplies. First stop: the largest supermarket to clear out every shelf of instant noodles and fuel. Then, I'll build the ultimate fortress."

### Track Objective:
Focus on the "Extreme Safety" and "Cathartic Hoarding" payoff.
