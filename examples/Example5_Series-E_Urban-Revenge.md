# Example 5: Series E - Urban Revenge

### Original Script Snippet:
"Three years ago, my wife's family kicked me out like a dog. Now, I'm standing in front of their company. My assistant whispers: 'Sir, the global bank merger is complete. You now own 51% of their debts.' I walk in, and my ex-mother-in-law shouts for security. I just hand her the eviction notice."

### Track Objective:
Focus on "Class Crossing" and high-magnitude "Identity Reveal" payoffs.
