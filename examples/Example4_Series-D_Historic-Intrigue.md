# Example 4: Series D - Historic Intrigue

### Original Script Snippet:
"I traveled back to the Ming Dynasty. I'm not a prince, just a commoner. But I brought the entire Wikipedia library in my head. Everyone is fighting for the crown, while I'm secretly building a steam engine in a small village. When the Northern invaders arrive, they won't meet arrows—they'll meet my Gatling guns."

### Track Objective:
Focus on "God-view Spoilers" and "Industrial Revolution" payoffs.
