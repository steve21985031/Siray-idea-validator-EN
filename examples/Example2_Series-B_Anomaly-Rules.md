# Example 2: Series B - Anomaly Rules

### Original Script Snippet:
"I applied for a job as a night security guard at a local museum. On my first day, it was just me and a set of rules. Rule #1: If you hear a child laughing in the Egyptian hall, do not look back. Rule #2: Ignore the red door that wasn't there during your daytime tour. Rule #3: Never let the flashlight batteries die."

### Track Objective:
Focus on the "Uncanny Valley" effect and "Adrenaline" from logic-solving.
