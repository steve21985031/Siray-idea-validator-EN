# Siray Comic-Drama Commercial Evaluation Rubric (v1.0)

This rubric defines the standards used by **DeepSeek V3.2** to audit and score script fragments.

## 📊 Dimension Definition

### 1. Market Fit (40%) - The "Hook" Logic
- **Definition**: Does the script align with short-form video platform completion algorithms?
- **S-Tier (90-100)**: Hits a viral sub-genre (e.g., Apocalypse Hoarding, Rule-based Ghost Stories, Revenge Hidden Identity) with a clear addictive loop.
- **A-Tier (80-89)**: Strong premise, predictable but high-performing structure.
- **B-Tier (70-79)**: Solid narrative but lacks "urgency" for short-form viewers.
- **C-Tier (<70)**: Typical "Writer's Self-Indulgence"; too slow-paced or lacks conflict.

### 2. Visual Spectacle (30%) - The "AI-Gen" Friendliness
- **Definition**: How well can this be represented by AI image generators (Midjourney/Flux)?
- **S-Tier (90-100)**: Contains high-contrast visuals, uncanny valley elements, or "Mega-scale" descriptions (e.g., "A skyscraper-tall mech fueled by talismans").
- **A-Tier (80-89)**: Clear, descriptive scenes with distinct lighting or color themes.
- **B-Tier (70-79)**: Primarily dialogue-driven; lacks strong visual anchors.
- **C-Tier (<70)**: High abstract concepts or generic office settings that look "boring" in comic form.

### 3. Concept Novelty (30%) - The "Setting Displacement" Factor
- **Definition**: Is it a generic clone or a "Micro-innovation" (T1-T5 Tactics)?
- **S-Tier (90-100)**: Brilliant "Setting Displacement" (e.g., "Cultivation in a Cyberpunk prison").
- **A-Tier (80-89)**: Standard trope with a significant "Reverse Upgrade" (Twist).
- **B-Tier (70-79)**: Minor changes to existing popular formulas.
- **C-Tier (<70)**: Cliché/Old tropes from 5 years ago (e.g., generic CEO falling for clumsy intern without a twist).

---
## ⚖️ Total Score Interpretation
- **90 - 100 (S)**: Greenlight for immediate production & high-budget AI rendering.
- **80 - 89 (A)**: Strong potential; minor tactical refinement suggested.
- **70 - 79 (B)**: Needs **Creative Fission (Step 3)** using T1-T5 Tactics.
- **< 70 (C)**: Commercial Failure; total fundamental structural overhaul required.
