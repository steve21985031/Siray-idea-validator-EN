# Siray Innovation Matrix: T1-T5 Targeted Tactics

This guide defines the "Targeted Micro-Innovation" framework used by **Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking** to upgrade scripts.

## ⚔️ The T-Tactics Library

### T1: Setting Displacement (The "Mashing" Technique)
- **Logic**: Take a standard character (CEO, Solider, Intern) and put them in an alien environment (Ancient Rome, Cyberpunk 2077, Cultivation World).
- **Goal**: Create cognitive dissonance that creates instant "Hooks."

### T2: Scale Multiplier (The "Magnitude" Upgrade)
- **Logic**: If the original has a "10-ton bomb," make it a "Sun-swallowing void."
- **Goal**: Maximize visual spectacle for AI generation.

### T3: Moral Ambiguity / Rule Reversal
- **Logic**: The Hero is the Villain; the System is the Curse. 
- **Goal**: Break audience expectations within the first 3 seconds.

### T4: Visual First / Uncanny Valley
- **Logic**: Define a scene that *must* be seen to be believed. Focus on non-human logic or surreal physics.
- **Goal**: High-hook rate (Retention) for thumb-stopping visuals.

### T5: Proxy Catharsis (High Payoff)
- **Logic**: Identify a specific social frustration (workplace bullying, class divide) and execute a high-magnitude "Slap-back."
- **Goal**: Drive emotional addiction.
